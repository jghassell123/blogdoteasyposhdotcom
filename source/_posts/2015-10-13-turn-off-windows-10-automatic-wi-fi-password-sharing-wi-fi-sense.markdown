Do the Internet a favor and disable / turn off Wi-Fi Sense in Windows 10. 

What is Windows 10 Wi-Fi Sense? It is Windows 10 automatically sharing wireless network passwords with your friends. It's wrong and a big security problem and you should just turn it off.

It's pretty easy to do.

Go to Settings > Network & Internet > Wi-Fi > Manage Wi-Fi Settings.

Uncheck the boxes beside Outlook.com contacts, Skype contacts, and Facebook friends.

For increased security, turn off the option "Connect to networks shared by my contacts" and "Connect to suggested open hotspots" â€” this doesn't remove your ability to connect to any networks, but it does prevent Windows from automatically connecting to SSIDs.
